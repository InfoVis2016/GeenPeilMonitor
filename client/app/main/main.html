		<h1>So what is it?</h1>
		<h2>GeenPeil is an initiative to hold a referendum in The Netherlands about the European Union Association Agreement with Ukraine.</h2>
		<h2>The initiative gathered more than 300000 autographs of the dutch people - enough to initiate a referendum. The referendum will be held on the sixth of april 2016 accordingly.</h2>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<h1>What does it do?</h1>
		<h2>The Association Agreement allows Ukraine to more actively participate with member countries in the European Union.</h2>
		<h2>This means more cooperation on military and economical aspects.</h2>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<h1>Why should you care?</h1>
		<h2>Do you want more democracy or do you want everything to be decided for you?</h2>
		<h2>Do you want more or less ties with Ukraine?</h2>
		<h2>Do you see Russia as a bully or as an ally?</h2>
		<h1>If these topics are of concern to you, do yourself a favor and vote on the 6th!</h1>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<h1>The number of voting offices has been decreased</h1>
		<h2>GeenPeil supporters say the governmet is actively working against GeenPeil, and has summoned municipalities who have decreased the number of voting offices [1].</h2>
		<h2>The government says this is due to a lower expected attendance [2].</h2>

		<h1>Government support</h1>
		<h2>The VVD and the PVDA formed a coalition as a result of the dutch elections in 2012.</h2> 
		<h2>According to current polls, results would not be the same of elections would be held today.</h2> 
		<h2>It would be interesting to see what the outcome of the referendum would be if we would still support our current government.</h2>
