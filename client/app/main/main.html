		<h1>So what is it?</h1>
		<h1>GeenPeil is an initiative to hold a referendum in The Netherlands about the European Union Association Agreement with Ukraine.</h1>
		<h1>The initiative gathered more than 300000 autographs of the dutch people - enough to initiate a referendum. The referendum will be held on the sixth of april 2016 accordingly.</h1>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<h1>What does it do?</h1>
		<h1>The Association Agreement allows Ukraine to more actively participate with member countries in the European Union.</h1>
		<h1>This means more cooperation on military and economical aspects.</h1>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<h1>Why should you care?</h1>
		<h1>Do you want more democracy or do you want everything to be decided for you?</h1>
		<h1>Do you want more or less ties with Ukraine?</h1>
		<h1>Do you see Russia as a bully or as an ally?</h1>
		<h1>If these topics are of concern to you, do yourself a favor and vote on the 6th!</h1>

		<h1>Government support</h1>
		<h1>The VVD and the PVDA formed a coalition as a result of the dutch elections in 2012.</h1> 
		<h1>However, according to current polls, results would not be the same of elections would be held today.</h1> 
		<h1>Therefore, it would be interesting to see what the outcome of the referendum would be if we would still support our current government.</h1>
